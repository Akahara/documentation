This repository contains various documentation documents about various topics written at various times. It is hosted on [github.com/Akahara/documentation](https://github.com/Akahara/documentation).

The intended way to read markdown files in this repo is to go at [acalais.fr/documentation](https://acalais.fr/documentation), github's markdown is fine but not quite good enough for my taste.

If you see a mistake tell me, I'll happily correct it !
You can also contribute things, as long as you credit yourself in the document somewhere.

Happy reading :)
